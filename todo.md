Test with `nodemon index.js`
Full CRUD functionality with Mongoose queries (no Express yet)

3. Create a new restaurant.

4. Write a function or method that finds a restaurant by `name`.

5. Write a function or method that finds all restaurants by `zipCode`.

6. Create a function that updates a restaurant.

7. Write a function or method that deletes a restaurant.

8. Write methods to add and remove embedded menu item documents for a restaurant of your choosing.

## Part II: Add Express

> You will know how to do this after Monday morning's Express + Mongoose lesson. Feel free, however, to give this a shot over the weekend.

Turn YUM into an Express app with routes that you can view in your browser and forms that manipulate your data with full CRUD.

Your app should have two pages...

- A page that lists all restaurants, on which a user can create a new restaurant.
- A page that lists one restaurant and all its menu items, on which a user can...
  - Delete the restaurant.
  - Update the restaurant.
  - Create a new menu item for the restaurant.
  - Delete a menu item from the restaurant.
