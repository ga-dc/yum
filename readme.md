    * items (array containing your items schema)

  - A menu item should contain the following:

    * title (a string)

3. Create a new restaurant:
  

4. Write a function or method that finds a restaurant by name

7. Write a function or method that deletes a restaurant

8. Write methods to add and remove embedded menu item documents for a restaurant of your choosing.
