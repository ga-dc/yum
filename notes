o fix this:

Reboot your Mac into safe mode  Hold Shif while restarting
goto Terminal and issue: csrutil disable
Reboot your Mac to normal mode
Change restricted flag to nonrestricted for that location. In Terminal: sudo chflags norestricted /private/tmp. And sudo chflags norestricted /tmp (not sure if this one is needed)
Change permissions as well if needed: sudo chmod 1777 /tmp and sudo chmod 1777 /private/tmp
Reboot to safe mode again, and do a csrutil enable back
That solved my problem.
